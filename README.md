## 📖 About
The **swiftembed-benchmarks** repository contains benchmarking scripts tailored for the **SwiftEmbed** embedding system. This system uses a static token lookup method to provide **ultra-low latency** text embeddings. Whether you're involved in natural language processing or just curious about text embeddings, these scripts will help you understand the performance of this approach.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 System Requirements
To run this application, you need the following:
- A computer with a recent version of **Windows**, **macOS**, or **Linux**.
- At least **4 GB** of RAM.
- **2 GB** of free disk space for downloads and scripts.
- An active internet connection for downloading the application.

### 🔧 Installing

   - On **Linux**, open the terminal from your applications menu.

2. **Change Directory**
   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder. Type `cd path_to_your_folder` and press Enter. Replace `path_to_your_folder` with the actual path where you extracted the zip file.

3. **Run the Benchmark Scripts**
   To run a specific benchmarking script, type the command for that script followed by any necessary parameters. For example, you might type `./run_benchmarks.sh` or `python benchmark_script.py`. Refer to the README file within the folder for specific command details.

### 📝 Usage Guide
1. **Choose a Benchmark**
   Review the available scripts and choose the one that fits your testing needs. Each script will be accompanied by descriptions and instructions.

2. **Execute the Script**
   Enter the command in the terminal to run the benchmark. The script will execute and display results in the terminal.

3. **Review Results**
   The output will provide valuable insights about the performance, including speed and efficiency.

### 📂 Examples 
Here are a few common use cases for using the benchmark scripts:
- Evaluating speed for different token lookup methods.
- Comparing various models for text embedding.
- Testing performance under different system loads.
